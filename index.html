            <h2>We are Amateur Cricketers!!</h2>
            <p>On the face of it, the distinctions between amateurs and professionals in first-class cricket were their
                availability and their means of remuneration. The professional cricketer received a wage from his county
                club or, if he went on a tour, a contracted fee paid by the tour organiser. In both cases, there was the
                possibility of bonuses being earned. The amateur in theory received expenses only, again paid either by
                his county club or a tour organiser. Professionals were full-time players during the cricket season and
                would mostly seek alternative employment in the winter months. The amateur was not always a full-time
                player during the season and many played by choice as they typically had other means of income or
                support. Some amateurs, those in education being a common example, were part-time players of necessity
                as they could only commit to cricket during the school or university holidays (say, late July to
                mid-September). Those in other forms of employment relied for availability on occasional holidays or, in
                some cases, being given time off by their employers. There were employers who hired well-known
                cricketers for commercial prestige reasons and so were keen to see them take part in big matches.</p>

            <p>In terms of cause and effect, however, availability and remuneration were effects only. The real
                distinction between amateur and professional, encapsulated by the Gentlemen v Players fixture which was
                first arranged by Lord Frederick Beauclerk in 1806 and played annually from 1829 to 1962, was social
                status within the English class structure. Amateurs (the Gentlemen) belonged to the upper and middle
                classes; professionals (the Players) invariably came from the working class. It was perceived that the
                amateur held a higher station in life and was therefore a class apart from the professional. The outlook
                of the two classes contrasted in that most of the amateurs played primarily for enjoyment, while most of
                the professionals took the game, as their living, very seriously indeed. Of underlying importance to the
                concept of amateurism were the schools, universities and other centres of education in which cricket was
                played, both as a curricular and extracurricular activity. The public schools (e.g., Eton, Harrow,
                Winchester) and the main universities (i.e., Oxford and Cambridge) produced most of the first-class
                amateur players and standards of amateur cricket rose during the 19th century through rivalry between
                the schools and then at university.</p>
